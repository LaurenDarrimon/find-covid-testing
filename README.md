## Description

As of January 2022, the US is seeing the highest Covid levels on record and tests are in demand now more than ever. We wanted to give users a place to quickly and easily find Covid testing sites in their area. It was our goal to make the website interface simple, clutter-free and easy to use. 
Our app currently works within the United States. It uses the Google Maps API to retrieve the users location and communicates that to the Here Developer API which provides detailed information about the testing sites. 

The user can either allow the browser to fetch their current location, or they can choose to enter either their state as a whole, or their zip code for more personalized results. 
Once the users location is determined, they will be able to view test site information either on the map directly or on the side panel that will appear. Both options will have the name of the test site, as well as an approximate location and phone number.
